# [Codebook](https://www.github.com/freitagfelipe/codebook) parser

- This project aims to capture all algorithms from my library, written in markdown files in the [Codebook](https://www.github.com/freitagfelipe/codebook) repository, while maintaining the folder structure. This way, I can print and use them during programming marathon competitions.
